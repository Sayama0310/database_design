# Automatic Design Algorithm for Databases

I will implement a relational database design algorithm using a synthetic approach for learning purposes.
This algorithm includes methods to find the minimal cover of functional dependencies and determine the equivalence of
two sets of functional dependencies.

The resulting relational schema obtained from this algorithm satisfies the properties of **functional dependency
preservation**, **third normal form**, and **lossless decomposition**. Excellent! ðŸŽ‰
